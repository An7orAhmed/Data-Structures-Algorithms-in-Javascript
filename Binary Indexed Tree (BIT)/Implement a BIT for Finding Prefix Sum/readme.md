# Implement_a_BIT_for_Finding_Prefix_Sum

**Author**: Antor Ahmed

 and the explanation. So, the code should be in the code block, and the explanation in Bangla, in a friendly and tutorial style. 

Looking at the example, it's a function add(a, b) => a + b. So, for the BIT, the code should be a JavaScript implementation with the necessary methods: add, prefixSum, and a build function. 

I should structure the code with a BIT class. The class should have methods for updating elements and computing prefix sums. 

I should explain the code in Bangla, step by step, making it clear for the audience. The explanation should be friendly, like Antor Ahmed is guiding the reader. 

I also need to ensure the code is correct and the explanation is clear, making it easy for the reader to understand BIT and how to use it for prefix sums. 

I should write the code and explanation in the specified format, with the code followed by the --$END$-- and the explanation. 

I need to be concise but thorough, making sure the code is correct and the explanation is detailed but easy to understand. 

I should also use correct Bangla terminology for the programming concepts to ensure the audience follows along. 

I should also format the code and explanation in the correct structure, with the code block and the explanation in a friendly Bangla style. 

I need to ensure the code is a proper implementation, with methods for updating the BIT and computing prefix sums. 

I should also explain the example in the explanation, like how the BIT is built and how the prefix sums are calculated.
