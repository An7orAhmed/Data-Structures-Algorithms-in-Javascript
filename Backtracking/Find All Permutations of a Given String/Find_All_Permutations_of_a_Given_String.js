Okay, I need to write the JavaScript function to find all permutations of a given string and explain it in Bangla like a friendly tutorial. Let's start by recalling how permutations work. For a string like 'abc', the permutations are all possible rearrangements, such as 'acb', 'bac', etc. 

First, the approach. The standard way to generate permutations recursively. For each character in the string, take that character out and generate permutations of the remaining characters, then combine the removed character with each of those permutations.

So, let's think about the base case. If the string has only one character, return an array with that single character. Otherwise, loop through each character, split the string into the current character and the rest, then recursively find permutations of the rest. For each permutation of the rest, prepend the current character. Collect all these results.

Now, code-wise. The function will be called findAllPermutations, taking a string as input. Handle the base case where if the string length is 1, return [string]. Then initialize an array to hold the results. Loop over each character in the string. For each character, create the remaining string by slicing, then get the permutations of the remaining. Then, for each permutation in those results, add the current char + permutation to the result array. Finally, return the result array.

Wait, but how to handle duplicate permutations if there are duplicate characters? Oh, but the problem says "given string", so maybe assuming it's allowed. The code might generate duplicates if there are repeated characters in the input. But the question doesn't specify handling duplicates, so perhaps leave it as is.

Testing with 'abc' would give 3! = 6 permutations. The code should handle that.

Now, in the explanation, need to break it down step by step in Bangla. Start by describing the function, base case, recursive steps. Use simple terms, maybe analogies. For example, like breaking down the problem into smaller parts.

Make sure the code is written correctly. Wait, in JavaScript, when slicing, for example, for the first iteration, currentChar is str[0], and remainingStr is str.slice(0,0) + str.slice(1). Wait, noâ€”if the string is 'abc', currentChar is 'a', remainingStr is str.slice(0, 0) (which is empty) + str.slice(1) (
